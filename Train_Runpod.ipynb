    "\n",
    "[General Instructions](https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream2trainer/blob/main/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can sign up for Runpod here (shameless referral link): [Runpod](https://runpod.io/?ref=oko38cd0)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are confused by the wall of text, join the discord here: [EveryDream Discord](https://discord.gg/uheqxU6sXN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Select the `RunPod Stable Diffusion v2.1` template. The `RunPod PyTorch` template does not work due to an old version of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage\n",
    "Remember, on RunPod time is more expensive than storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which is good, because running a lot of experiments can generate a lot of data. Not having the right save points to recover quickly from inevitable mistakes will cost you a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt, give yourself ~125GB of Runpod **Volume** storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparation\n",
    "You will want to have your data prepared before starting, and have a rough training plan in mind. Don't waste rental fees if you're not fully prepared to start training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your files should be captioned before you start with either the caption as the filename or in text files for each image alongside the image files.  See [DATA.md](https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream2trainer/blob/main/doc/DATA.md) for more details. Tools are available to automatically caption your files."
